#Whiteboard — Airline Agent Task Tracker
Overview
##Whiteboard is a web-based internal dashboard built for airline agents to track shift assignments and manage flight-related tasks. The app includes agent-to-flight assignments, shift tracking, and real-time displays like a task countdown and current clock. Built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, this project was a hands-on learning experience in backend development, database integration, and clean software architecture.

Tech Stack
Backend: Java 17, Spring Boot

Database: PostgreSQL (via Docker and local setup)

ORM: Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)

Security: Spring Security (form login, with plans for password hashing)

Tools: Maven, Postman, IntelliJ/Eclipse, Docker

Features
Agent login (secured access, non-public)

Add, edit, and remove flight information (passenger load, gate time, special notes)

Assign agents to specific flights

Track agent shift status (on-shift, assigned, idle)

Real-time task countdown timers and clock

Planned integration with Aviation Edge for real-time flight data

What I Learned
Spring Boot Foundations
This was my first time using Spring Boot

Learned how to structure code into controller, service, repository, and model layers

Understood key annotations like @RestController, @Service, @Repository, and @Entity

DTOs vs Entities
Learned the difference between database entities and data transfer objects (DTOs)

Practiced clean separation of concerns to avoid exposing internal data structures

JPA and PostgreSQL Integration
First time using a real backend-to-database setup with PostgreSQL

Used Spring Data JPA for CRUD operations

Explored how JPA interacts with the actual database schema and learned to read SQL tables generated by the app

Clean Architecture and Code Structure
Built services to isolate business logic

Used DTO mapping to decouple frontend responses from database models

Practiced writing maintainable code with room for future features

Security and Authentication
Implemented basic Spring Security route protection

Learned about login configuration and preparing for secure password hashing with BCrypt

Gained insight into why backend security matters even for internal tools

Real-World Development Lessons
Dealt with actual developer frustrations: project structure confusion, annotation bugs, database setup issues

Learned by doing — not everything worked right away, but that’s where the growth happened

Gained a stronger understanding of backend systems and how to troubleshoot them

Reflection
This was my first complete backend project with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. While not perfect, it helped me:

Break through my fear of Spring and backend development

Understand how real applications talk to databases

Practice clean code and architecture

Gain clarity on how backend security, data flow, and service logic all work together

It also helped me realize that learning by building is the best way forward. I now have a much stronger foundation to build from, even if I don't remember everything off the top of my head.

Future Plans
Finish countdown and timing logic

Add JWT or session-based login

Connect to real flight data via an external API

Build a frontend interface (or connect with JavaFX)

Add logging for changes (via Hibernate Envers or custom solution)

Write proper tests for controllers and services
