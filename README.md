# Whiteboard

## ⚠️ Project Archived

This project was an in-progress flight tracking tool built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. It has been **archived due to API cost limitations**, but it served as a valuable learning experience in backend architecture, DTO design, and RESTful service structure.

Skills explored:
- Spring Boot CRUD APIs
- Entity/DTO separation
- PostgreSQL schema design
- Git branching and workflow
