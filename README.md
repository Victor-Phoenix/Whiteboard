# Whiteboard — Airline Agent Task Tracker

## Overview

Whiteboard is a backend-focused internal dashboard built for airline agents to track shift assignments, flight details, and task timers. It was designed as a functional operations tool—allowing agents to be assigned to flights, view upcoming departures, and monitor special instructions and timing.

The backend was developed using **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**, with real-time flight data pulled from the **Aviation Edge API**. After successfully setting up the API connection and receiving valid responses, I began working on the frontend and learning how to connect it to the backend.

This was my first project combining Spring Boot, real-time external data, and a live SQL database. It helped me deeply understand backend architecture, data modeling, security, and service layering.

Although the project was eventually **discontinued due to the cost of using the Aviation Edge API**, it served as a critical milestone in my learning. It taught me how to build a working backend system from scratch, structure a production-level codebase, and integrate a real database and API.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Java 17, Spring Boot  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Docker and local setup)  
- **ORM:** Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)  
- **Security:** Spring Security (form login, with plans for password hashing)  
- **Tools:** Maven, Postman, IntelliJ/Eclipse, Docker

## Features

- Agent login (secured access, non-public)  
- Add, edit, and remove flight information (passenger load, gate time, special notes)  
- Assign agents to specific flights  
- Track agent shift status (on-shift, assigned, idle)  
- Real-time task countdown timers and clock  
- Planned integration with Aviation Edge for real-time flight data

## What I Learned

### Spring Boot Foundations

- This was my first time using Spring Boot  
- Learned how to structure code into controller, service, repository, and model layers  
- Understood key annotations like `@RestController`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, and `@Entity`  

### DTOs vs Entities

- Learned the difference between database entities and data transfer objects (DTOs)  
- Practiced clean separation of concerns to avoid exposing internal data structures  

### JPA and PostgreSQL Integration

- First time using a real backend-to-database setup with PostgreSQL  
- Used Spring Data JPA for CRUD operations  
- Explored how JPA interacts with the actual database schema and learned to read SQL tables generated by the app  

### Clean Architecture and Code Structure

- Built services to isolate business logic  
- Used DTO mapping to decouple frontend responses from database models  
- Practiced writing maintainable code with room for future features  

### Security and Authentication

- Implemented basic Spring Security route protection  
- Learned about login configuration and preparing for secure password hashing with BCrypt  
- Gained insight into why backend security matters even for internal tools  

### Real-World Development Lessons

- Faced real-world challenges: project structure confusion, annotation bugs, PostgreSQL setup issues  
- Learned by doing — not everything worked right away, but those struggles helped me grow  
- Gained a stronger understanding of backend systems and how to troubleshoot them

## Project Status

This project has been **discontinued** as a completed learning milestone. It will not be developed further, but it served as a valuable experience in backend development and system architecture.
